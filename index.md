CMS / MAC CLINICAL NECESSITY RULES  
PHYSICAL THERAPY — HOME HEALTH  
AUTHORITATIVE EXECUTION SPEC

These rules define CMS and MAC medical necessity requirements for skilled physical therapy.
They override default language patterns and generic therapy narratives.

---

RULE 1 — SKILLED NEED

Skilled physical therapy is required when patient deficits demand licensed therapist judgment for safety assessment, real-time modification, clinical decision-making, progression, or corrective cueing.

If the service could be safely and effectively performed without therapist assessment or adjustment, it is not skilled.

---

RULE 2 — COMPLEXITY

Services are skilled when patient presentation includes impaired balance, instability, cognitive impairment, neurologic involvement, fluctuating endurance, pain limiting function, high fall risk, or interacting co-morbidities.

---

RULE 3 — PROGRESS REQUIREMENT

Continued therapy is justified by measurable improvement OR a reasonable expectation of improvement based on response to skilled intervention and declared rehab potential.

---

RULE 4 — NON-SKILLED EXCLUSION

Therapy is not skilled when documentation reflects repetitive exercise without assessment, maintenance only without justification, or lack of modification.

---

RULE 5 — CAUSAL CHAIN (REQUIRED)

Impairment → Functional Limitation → Safety Risk → Skilled Intervention → Outcome

---

RULE 6 — HOMEBOUND LINKAGE

Homebound status must specify why leaving home requires considerable effort or is medically inadvisable, what assistance or device is required, and how the condition causes the limitation.

---

RULE 7 — CO-MORBIDITY IMPACT

Co-morbidities must be described by how they limit sequencing, endurance, stability, carryover, or require therapist oversight.
