2) Specific functional/medical reasons
- Identify the impairments/risks that make leaving home taxing or unsafe (from documents only).

3) Required assistance or device
- Who helps (caregiver) and/or what device is required (RW, WC, oxygen, etc.), if documented.

4) Practical statement

Rules
- No boilerplate.
