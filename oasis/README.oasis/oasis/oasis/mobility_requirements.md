Mobility Documentation Requirements (SOC/OASIS intent)

Principle
Functional ability must be documented by task domain, not as a single global statement.

Domains that must be addressed (or labeled "not provided")
1) Bed mobility
- rolling
- supine↔sit

2) Transfers
- bed↔chair
- sit↔stand
- toilet transfer
- shower/tub transfer (if applicable)

3) Ambulation
- device (none/cane/RW/rollator/WC)
- assistance level (independent, supervision, SBA, CGA, min/mod/max assist) if documented
- distance if documented

4) Stairs
- whether stairs are present in the home setup
- ability/assistance if documented

5) Wheelchair mobility
- if wheelchair is primary mode, document propulsion/assistance if documented

Prohibited
- Inferring assistance levels
- Combining multiple domains into one vague sentence
- Omitting a domain without stating "not provided"
