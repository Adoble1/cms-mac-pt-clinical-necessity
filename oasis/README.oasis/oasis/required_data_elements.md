SOC Required Data Elements (PT chart review)

The agent must extract and/or explicitly label "not provided" for each item below.

Precautions and medical constraints
- Weight-bearing status per limb (WBAT, TTWB, PWB, NWB) and any activity restrictions
- Oxygen use (none vs in use); if in use: device type and ordered flow settings; rest vs activity instructions
- Fall precautions or safety precautions listed in documents
- Lines/tubes/equipment affecting mobility (IV, wound vac, catheter, drains) if documented

Mobility and function (OASIS intent)
- Bed mobility (rolling, supine↔sit) and assistance level
- Transfers (bed, chair, toilet, shower) and assistance level
- Ambulation (device, assistance level, distance if documented)
- Stairs (present in home and ability if documented)
- Wheelchair mobility if relevant (primary mode vs occasional)

Other function/safety domains commonly needed at SOC
- Cognition/communication affecting safety (if documented)
- Pain impact on function (if documented)
- Endurance/activity tolerance limits (if documented)

Rule
- If a required item is not documented in supplied records, write "not provided" and treat as a documentation gap.
- Do not guess WB status or oxygen use.
