SOC safety expectations:

Agent must explicitly extract or flag missing:
- Weight-bearing status per limb
- Orthopedic or surgical precautions
- Cardiac or medical activity restrictions
- Oxygen use (device, flow, rest vs activity)
- Lines, tubes, or equipment affecting mobility
- Cognitive or behavioral safety risks

No assumptions permitted.
