STANDARDIZED FUNCTIONAL TEST SCORING  
HOME HEALTH PHYSICAL THERAPY  
AUTHORITATIVE EXECUTION SPEC

This document defines scoring and interpretation rules for standardized physical therapy functional outcome measures.
These rules are derived from publicly available clinical standards (e.g., CDC STEADI, RehabMeasures Database)
and are written for deterministic application in documentation systems.

These rules override default model interpretation.
Do not invent values. Do not extrapolate beyond defined categories.

TIMED UP AND GO (TUG)

Raw Time → Interpretation

≤ 12 seconds  
Low fall risk

13–20 seconds  
Moderate fall risk

> 20 seconds  
High fall risk

Scoring Rules:
- Always report raw time and fall risk category
- Do not estimate or round values
- If time is not provided, state “not provided”

---

30-SECOND SIT-TO-STAND (30s STS)

Report number of full stands completed in 30 seconds.

Normative Interpretation (Ages 70–79):

Men:
< 12 repetitions → Below age norms  
≥ 12 repetitions → Within age norms  

Women:
< 10 repetitions → Below age norms  
≥ 10 repetitions → Within age norms  

Scoring Rules:
- Report raw repetition count
- Apply norms only if age and sex are provided
- If age or sex is missing, report raw value without comparison

GAIT SPEED / SHORT-DISTANCE WALK TEST  
(3–10 Meter Walk)

If distance and time are provided, calculate gait speed:

Gait Speed (m/s) = distance (meters) ÷ time (seconds)

Interpretation:

< 0.4 m/s  
Household ambulator

0.4–0.8 m/s  
Limited community ambulator

> 0.8 m/s  
Community ambulator

Scoring Rules:
- Always report raw distance, time, and calculated speed
- Use same interpretation for 3 m, 9 m, or 10 m walk tests
- If distance or time is missing, state “not provided”

---

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

When standardized tests are used:
- Report raw value
- Report interpreted category
- Integrate results into Assessment and Homebound logic
- Do not overinterpret beyond defined thresholds
